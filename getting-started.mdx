    <CodeGroup tabs="Terminal,Web Interface">
      ```bash
git clone https://github.com/ujjwal/documentation-template.git
cd documentation-template
npm install
```
      ```javascript
// Web setup via dashboard

});
```
    </CodeGroup>

</Steps>

## Navigation Structure

Ujjwal Anand Documentation uses a flexible tab-based navigation system. You can organize content into logical groups and subgroups for easy access.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Basic Setup" icon="home">
    Start with a simple structure: Introduction, Getting Started, and API Reference tabs.

    <Expandable title="Navigation Best Practices" default-open="false">
      Use descriptive tab names and group content by user journey rather than technical categories.
    </Expandable>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Advanced Organization" icon="layers">
    For complex projects, consider using nested groups and expandable sections.

    <Callout kind="tip">
      Keep navigation shallow - users should find content within 2-3 clicks.
    </Callout>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Component Usage

Master the component system to create engaging documentation. Each page should use at least 5-8 different component types for comprehensive coverage.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Visual Components" icon="image" href="#">
    Cards, columns, and tabs enhance visual appeal and organization.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Instructional Elements" icon="book-open" href="#">
    Steps and code blocks provide clear, actionable guidance.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Supporting Content" icon="info" href="#">
    Callouts and expandable sections add context and details.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Interactive Features" icon="play" href="#">

  </Card>
</Columns>
